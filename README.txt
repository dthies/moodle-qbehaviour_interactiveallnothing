qbehaviour_interactiveallnothing
=================

This is a question behaviour for Moodle Quiz that forces all questions
to be graded all or nothing using interactive mode. It will work with a
variety of question types that normally produce credit for partially
correct responses i.e. cloze, matching, OU drag and drop types etc.

Copy this directory to question/behaviour/interactiveallnothing in
Moodle directory root. Login as admin to complete plugin installation.
Then choose this behaviour while editng quiz settings. All questions in
the quiz will then always will receive zero or the maximum marks after
penalty for attempts when graded.
